# Logo Usage Guidelines

## Primary Logo

The TEDxBreckenridge logo consists of two elements:
- **TEDˣ** in the official TED red with superscript "x"
- **Breckenridge** in black (or white on dark backgrounds)

The logo must always be displayed as a single unit. TEDx and the location name are written as one word or with "Breckenridge" dropped to the following line.

## Logo Configurations

**Stacked Version (Preferred)**
```
TEDˣ
Breckenridge
```

**Horizontal Version**
```
TEDˣBreckenridge
```

## Typography in Logo

Based on the transparent logo file (TEDxBreckenridge_trans.webp):

- **"TED"** — Bold, condensed sans-serif in TED Red
- **"x"** — Superscript, same red, slightly smaller
- **"Breckenridge"** — Helvetica Light/Regular, black or white depending on background
- The "x" sits at superscript height aligned with the top of "TED"
- Tagline "x = independently organized TED event" appears in small red text below when space permits

## Logo Clearspace

Maintain a minimum buffer zone around the logo perimeter equal to **X/3** (where X = the height of the TEDx portion). No other logos, graphics, or text may appear within this zone.

## Approved Background Colors

- Solid white
- Solid black

**Never place the logo on:**
- Colored backgrounds
- Photographic backgrounds
- Patterned or illustrated backgrounds

## Logo Don'ts

❌ Do not set "Breckenridge" in all caps
❌ Do not change the color of TEDx or the "x"
❌ Do not write the place name in colors other than black or white
❌ Do not use typefaces other than Helvetica or Inter Light
❌ Do not lock up with other logos or images
❌ Do not use TED or TEDx logos alone (always use full event name)

## Supporting Graphics

### Evergreen X Mark

The stylized "X" graphic featuring mountain-inspired geometric shapes in teal and coral/red may be used to enhance the brand identity or as a standalone representation.

**Usage Guidelines:**
- When paired with the logomark, use the stacked version
- Align "Breckenridge" to match the width of the X graphic
- Avoid noisy backgrounds with competing colors or busy patterns
