# 2025 Theme: Metamorphosis

## Concept

Metamorphosis represents a multi-staged transformation process. Like a caterpillar retreating into a chrysalis, the theme explores:
- Complete transformation while preserving core identity (imaginal cells)
- The struggle of emergence that builds strength
- Breaking down, rediscovering oneself, and ultimately flourishing

## Visual Metaphors

- Northern Lights transformation
- Snow and water vapor metamorphosis
- Circle casting shadow of an "X" (opposing shapes: X and O)
- The "X" resembling crossed skis

## Theme Logo

The Metamorphosis wordmark features a tilted oval/ring graphic integrated into the word, with the "O" replaced by the ring element.

**Usage:** Theme graphics always defer to TED branding. The theme serves as the event "tagline" while TED is the overarching brand.

## Color Inspiration

The 2025 theme colors are inspired by the Northern Lights, reflecting transformation and the shifting hues of winter skies:
- **Violet** - Soft opening of twilight
- **Lilac** - Primary vibrant aurora
- **Twilight** - Deep evening sky
- **Aqua** - Cool mountain air
- **Mint** - Fresh emergence
- **Eclipse** - Profound darkness before transformation
