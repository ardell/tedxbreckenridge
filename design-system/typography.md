Helvetica is an integral part of the TEDx visual identity and comes pre-installed on most computers.

## Type Specifications

| Element | Weight | Tracking |
|---------|--------|----------|

| Body Copy | Regular/Light | 0 |
| Logo Text | Regular | 0 |

## Alignment Rules

- "Breckenridge" always aligns left relative to "TEDx"
- Should be sized to exactly match the height of "TEDx"

## Font Usage Guidelines

### For Brand Consistency
