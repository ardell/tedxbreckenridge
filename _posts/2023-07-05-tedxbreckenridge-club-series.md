**A night of community and connection**

By Charlotte Callahan

**What is one of your retreats, and how does it impact your return? Where do you go to be inspired and make connections in Summit County? Whether an uncommon relationship or an unexpected experience, what has been your lightbulb moment?**

Participants at the TEDxBreckenridge Club Series discussed these questions, and more, on a Tuesday evening in late June. The event is described as a "book club without the book." It's a place for the community to gather, watch TEDx Talks from past TEDxBreckenridge events, and discuss. After every few videos, a moderator gives a question for participants to discuss, based on the TEDxTalk. Partakers are encouraged to move around and talk to someone they do not know. It is a chance for people to slightly step out of their comfort zone. The theme of the last event, on Tuesday, June 27, was "B like Breckenridge", which covered tourism and stewardship in Breckenridge. Each talk was framed around the community or the outdoors.

I highly recommend attending these events. The TEDxBreckenridge club series is about learning about Breck, its residents, and yourself. For me, it was an opportunity to sit back and reflect in a fun and enlightening environment. As someone who loves to talk - and listen - this is great. When I find a speech interesting, I often want to discuss it. The TEDxBreckenridge club series gives you that opportunity. If someone does not want to participate in the conversation, they are welcome to just listen.

A talk that I found really interesting was given by two teenage girls who discussed the importance of intergenerational connections. To answer the question presented, I talked to people who are of a different generation than I am. It was a chance for me to find a commonly shared interest that I otherwise could not have learned about.

Over the course of the evening, each talk promoted different observations and answers. Discussing these questions helped me learn what other people in Breckenridge enjoy doing and what makes them tick. When asked, "Where do you go to be inspired and make connections in Summit County?" people had vast answers, including places like yoga studios, coffee shops, and volunteer events. This event gave me a chance to learn other people's stories that I might never have heard had I not attended. For someone who does not live in Breckenridge, it was an excellent chance for me to see a sneak peek into the community that I love so much. The event is about the community, for the community.
