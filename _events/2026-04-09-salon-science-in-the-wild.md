What does it take to protect a mountain community from wildfire? How do we inspire young people to explore the natural world through science? And what can we learn when fire specialists and outdoor educators come together to share their knowledge?

Join us for this TEDxBreckenridge Salon as we explore the intersection of wildfire science and environmental education. The evening features experts from two organizations working to keep our community safe and connected to the natural world: [Summit Fire & EMS](https://www.summitfire.org/) and [Keystone Science School](https://www.keystonescienceschool.org/).

## About the Topic

Living in the Colorado high country means living with fire. Our forests, our neighborhoods, and our way of life all depend on understanding how fire behaves—and how we can prepare for it. At the same time, the mountains around us offer incredible opportunities for hands-on learning about ecology, climate, and the natural systems that shape our environment.

This Salon brings together two perspectives on science in the wild: the practical, life-saving work of wildland fire management, and the curiosity-driven exploration of outdoor education. Together, we'll discover how science helps us both protect and appreciate our mountain home.

## About the Speakers

**Hannah Ohlson** serves as a Wildland Fuels Specialist with [Summit Fire & EMS](https://www.summitfire.org/), where she works to reduce wildfire risk and prepare our community for fire season. Her work combines fire behavior science, forestry, and community education to help residents understand and mitigate the risks of living in the wildland-urban interface.

**Speaker TBD** from [Keystone Science School](https://www.keystonescienceschool.org/) will share insights on environmental education and outdoor science programming. (Speaker details coming soon.)

## About TEDxBreckenridge Salons

TEDxBreckenridge Salon events are conversational gatherings that bring curious minds together to explore compelling topics. Unlike traditional lectures, Salons emphasize discussion, questions, and the exchange of ideas—creating space for deeper learning and authentic community connection. These are small-capacity events designed for genuine conversation where everyone's voice can be heard.
