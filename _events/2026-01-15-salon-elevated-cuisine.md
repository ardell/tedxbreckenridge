Why does water boil at a lower temperature in the mountains? Why do cakes rise too fast—or not at all? And how do professional chefs adapt their techniques when cooking at 9,000 feet?

Join us for an intimate TEDxBreckenridge Salon exploring the fascinating science and art of cooking at high altitude. This special evening features Chefs [Kevin Clarke](https://coloradomtn.edu/faculty/clarke-kevin/) and [Bernhard Schrag](https://coloradomtn.edu/faculty/schrag-bernhard/) from [Colorado Mountain College](https://coloradomtn.edu/), who will share insights from years of teaching and practicing culinary arts at elevation.

## About the Topic

Living and cooking in the mountains presents unique challenges that sea-level recipes simply don't address. Water boils at lower temperatures. Cakes rise differently. Baking times change. Even the way flavors develop is affected by altitude. For anyone who's ever wondered why their favorite recipe doesn't work quite right in Colorado—or how professional chefs adapt their techniques for high-elevation kitchens—this Salon offers answers, strategies, and practical knowledge you can use in your own cooking.

## About the Speakers

**[Chef Kevin Clarke](https://coloradomtn.edu/faculty/clarke-kevin/)** serves as Director of Culinary Education at Colorado Mountain College and has led the Keystone campus culinary program since 2000. A 1996 graduate of CMC's inaugural Culinary Arts class, he returned to guide the next generation of mountain chefs after working at the historic Ski Tip Lodge and in Colorado's outdoor hospitality industry. Chef Clarke actively coaches student competition teams to state championships and brings deep expertise in high-altitude culinary education.

**[Chef Bernhard Schrag](https://coloradomtn.edu/faculty/schrag-bernhard/)** teaches culinary arts at CMC's Vail Valley campus in Edwards. With degrees in adult and vocational education from Australia and New Zealand, he brings an international perspective to the challenges and opportunities of cooking in the High Rockies. His teaching emphasizes both technical precision and creative adaptation—essential skills for successful high-altitude cooking.

## What to Expect

The evening begins with a presentation exploring how altitude fundamentally changes cooking and baking. You'll learn the science behind why certain techniques fail at elevation, and discover the adjustments that professional chefs make to achieve consistent, delicious results. Following the talk, we'll open the floor for questions—bring your toughest cooking challenges and get expert guidance from two seasoned culinary educators.

The Salon concludes with small-group discussion, where you'll connect with fellow food enthusiasts to share experiences, exchange tips, and explore how altitude affects the way we cook, bake, and entertain in our mountain communities.
