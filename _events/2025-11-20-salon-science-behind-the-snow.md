How does Arapahoe Basin manage to open before almost every other ski area in North America? What goes into the decision to start making snow, and how do they turn a few inches of manmade coverage into skiable terrain?

In this TEDxBreckenridge Salon, the snowmaking team from Arapahoe Basin Ski Area shared the behind-the-scenes science and strategy that enables them to start the season before everyone else.

## What We Explored

- The technology and techniques behind artificial snow production
- How terrain is prepared and managed for early-season skiing
- How weather patterns and data drive operational decisions
- What it means to operate at 10,530+ feet
- The regulatory considerations that shape mountain operations

## Why Are Snowflakes Hexagonal?

We also watched this video exploring why snowflakes form in hexagonal structures and why no two snowflakes are the same.

<p class="mt-32">Thank you to everyone who joined us for this fascinating look at the intersection of science, strategy, and skiing!</p>
