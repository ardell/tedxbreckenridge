    <h2>What is TEDx?</h2>
    <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEDx</a> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED Talks</a> video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.</p>
