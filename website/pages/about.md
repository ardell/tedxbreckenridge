<h2>What is TEDx?</h2>

<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEDx</a> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED Talks</a> video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.</p>

<p>Since our inaugural event in 2020, we've hosted five main events featuring 53 speakers who have shared transformative ideas with our community. Our talks have reached audiences far beyond the mountains, with videos garnering hundreds of thousands of views worldwide. Each October, we gather at the Riverwalk Center in Breckenridge for an evening of ideas worth spreading, bringing together locals and visitors alike for meaningful conversation and connection.</p>

<p>Beyond our annual main event, we host intimate Salon gatherings throughout the year—smaller, conversational events designed to explore fascinating topics with local experts. These Salons create space for deeper discussion and genuine connection, embodying our belief that the best ideas emerge when curious minds come together.</p>
