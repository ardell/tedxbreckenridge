**By the TEDxBreckenridge Team**

---

Here's the truth about putting on a TEDx event: it takes a village. Actually, it takes more than a village—it takes an extraordinary team of passionate, talented people who believe that ideas can change our community.

We're building that team right now for 2026, and we want you to be part of it.

Whether you have two hours to spare on event day or you're ready to dive deep into planning our year-round salon series and our main event in October, there's a place for you on the TEDxBreckenridge volunteer team. And here's what makes this different: we're not looking for people who can do everything. We're looking for people who can own one thing and be great at it.

Below, you'll find volunteer opportunities organized by category. Read through them, find the one that makes you think "I could really excel at this," and let's make 2026 our best year yet.

**Marketing**
Help develop and execute marketing campaigns that get people excited about our events. This includes coordinating promotional strategies, identifying target audiences, and finding creative ways to amplify our message across Summit County and beyond.

**Social Media Management**
Create engaging content, manage our social channels, interact with our online community, and help build buzz around speakers, events, and ideas. If you live and breathe Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or LinkedIn—and you know how to spark genuine conversations—this is your role.

**Blog & Newsletter Copywriting**
Write compelling stories about our speakers, events, and the ideas that emerge from our community. Help craft email newsletters that inspire action and blog posts that resonate long after the event ends.

**Press & Media Relations**
Build relationships with local and regional media outlets. Write press releases, pitch stories to journalists, and help position TEDxBreckenridge as a source for thought-provoking content and community impact.

**Website Updates & Maintenance**
Keep our website fresh, accurate, and engaging. Update event details, publish blog posts, optimize for SEO, and ensure the site provides an excellent user experience on mobile and desktop.

**Graphic Design**
Design eye-catching graphics for social media, event materials, promotional campaigns, and print collateral. Help maintain our visual identity and create designs that reflect the energy and curiosity of TED.

**Community Outreach**
Connect with local organizations, businesses, and community groups to spread the word about our events and build meaningful partnerships. This role involves significant crossover with our salon events, where grassroots connections matter most.

## Partnerships & Resources

**Sponsorships, Sales & Partnerships**
Build relationships with local businesses and organizations who want to support our mission. Present sponsorship opportunities, negotiate packages, and help secure funding that keeps our events accessible and impactful.

**Vendor Coordination & In-Kind Donations**
Coordinate with caterers, rental companies, and other vendors to create exceptional event experiences. Solicit in-kind donations for food, beverages, and our intermission cookie tradition—yes, that's a real thing, and it's beloved.

**Speaker Selection & Proposal Evaluation**
Read and evaluate speaker proposals throughout the year. Help identify compelling ideas, strong storytelling, and voices that deserve to be amplified. This is where great events begin—by recognizing brilliance before it takes the stage.

**Audition Coordination**
Organize and facilitate speaker auditions, including scheduling, venue logistics, feedback collection, and communication with applicants. Help create an experience that's both professional and welcoming.

**Speaker Mastermind Coordination**
Support our speaker development process by coordinating mastermind sessions where speakers refine their talks, give each other feedback, and grow together as storytellers.

**Rehearsal Coordination**
Schedule and manage speaker rehearsals leading up to the main event. Ensure speakers have the time, space, and resources they need to deliver their best performances.

**Salon Speaker Coordination**
Work with speakers for our intimate salon series throughout the year. These smaller events are where we experiment, connect deeply with audiences, and give emerging voices a platform to shine.

## Event Day Magic

**Registration & Check-In**
Welcome attendees, manage check-in processes, distribute materials, and ensure everyone feels taken care of from the moment they arrive.

**Venue Setup & Teardown**
Help transform spaces into welcoming environments before events and ensure everything is cleaned up and returned to order afterward. This includes arranging seating, setting up signage, coordinating decorations, and more.

**Ushers & Greeters**
Be the friendly face of TEDxBreckenridge. Guide attendees to their seats, answer questions, and help create a warm, inclusive atmosphere.

**Hospitality & Green Room Coordination**
Take care of our speakers behind the scenes. Manage the green room, ensure speakers have everything they need (water, snacks, quiet space), and help them feel supported before they take the stage.

**Event Day Logistics**
Coordinate the thousand little details that make events run smoothly—from managing timelines to troubleshooting unexpected issues. This is the role for problem-solvers who thrive under pressure.

**Accessibility Coordination**
Ensure our events are welcoming and accessible to everyone. Coordinate accommodations, manage accessibility needs, and help us create inclusive experiences that reflect our values.

Your work will help us share our story long after the event ends and will be featured on our website, social media, and promotional materials. (Note: post-event video editing for YouTube is handled by our videographer.)

**Stage Management**
Coordinate everything that happens on stage—speaker transitions, AV cues, timing, and troubleshooting. This role requires calm under pressure, excellent communication, and an eye for detail. (Note: the venue handles audio, lighting, and video equipment operation.)

**Accounting & Bookkeeping**
Help manage our finances—tracking expenses, processing invoices, reconciling accounts, and ensuring we're responsible stewards of every dollar donated and every sponsorship secured.

**Volunteer Coordination**
Be the person who keeps our volunteer team organized, supported, and inspired. Coordinate schedules, communicate updates, and ensure every volunteer feels valued and prepared for their role.

**Ticket Support & Customer Service**

Look, we know that's a lot. You might be thinking, "There's no way I can do all of that." And you're right—you can't. Nobody can. But you *can* do one thing exceptionally well.

Maybe you're the person who can write blog posts that make people stop scrolling. Maybe you're the detail-oriented genius who loves managing spreadsheets and keeping budgets in order. Maybe you're the extrovert who thrives on building sponsorship relationships. Or maybe you're the behind-the-scenes hero who makes sure speakers have everything they need five minutes before showtime.

Whatever your strength is, we need it.

TEDxBreckenridge happens because people like you show up. You bring your skills, your energy, and your belief that ideas can change the world—or at least our corner of it. And together, we create something extraordinary.

**Ready to find your role?** [Sign up to volunteer](https://www.tedxbreckenridge.com/volunteer/) and let us know where you'd like to contribute. We'll be in touch soon to get you connected with the team.
