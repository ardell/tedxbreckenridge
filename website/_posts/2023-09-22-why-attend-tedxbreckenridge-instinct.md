On Saturday, Sept. 30, TEDxBreckenridge will host its 4th annual TEDx event, INSTINCT. The event begins at 1 p.m. at the Riverwalk Center. Viewers are encouraged to come at 1 p.m. to enjoy other activities listed below. Here's everything you need to know about INSTINCT.

## Theme:

Every year, volunteers for TEDxBreckenridge gather and share their ideas for a theme that is relevant to the local community. It's a potluck-style event with a poll to decide on the theme at the end. This year's theme of INSTINCT was chosen because it ties in with hope and opens the opportunity for expansive interpretation!

## Speakers:

The event features 10 live TEDx Talks this year and 2 live performances. The emcee is Adam Maxwell, who is a producer and host at Outside. Some of the speakers include renowned hiker Chris Fisher, human rights activist Kara Napolitano, and banjo player Andy Thorn.

## What to do:

New this year to the event is Innovation Alley, which will feature Summit County's most innovative projects — companies and organizations who have turned their ideas and insights into unique products and services and in doing so, educate and inspire our attendees. The event will also feature 4 artists, each creating their own piece inspired by the theme, INSTINCT. There will also be an opportunity for ecstatic dance!

Make sure to check out the deconstructed goody bags, so visitors can choose what they want, while staying waste-conscious.

## Why you should go:

Going to a TEDxBreckenridge event is a great way to intellectually connect within the community.

It is a cool, generative experience with lots of conversations and people who are interested in listening and learning. Mountain communities often attract people who are curious, and INSTINCT satisfies that curiosity.

Also, anyone buying a ticket enters a raffle to win a Season Ski Pass at Arapahoe Basin.

TEDxBreckenridge INSTINCT will be an engaging way to socialize with other people, hear fantastic talks, and learn more about the Breckenridge community.
