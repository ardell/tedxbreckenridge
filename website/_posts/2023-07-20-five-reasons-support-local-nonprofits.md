Why donate to a local nonprofit? There are a couple reasons. Anytime you donate to a local nonprofit, you are helping make the community stronger. Sponsor co-director, Justin Hildebrand, says, "TEDxBreckenridge is bringing valuable, thought-expanding, challenges and educating the public to current events. Anytime an area is investing in educating the community the entire population rises."

Here are a few more reasons why your giving and support to TEDxBreckenridge makes a difference:

## Reason 1: 100% Run by Volunteers

Something that makes TEDxBreckenridge so special is that it is run completely by volunteers. All of the people who organize the events that our community enjoys, do it for free, because they care about bringing TEDx to our community. The volunteer team are local people, who live and work in this community, and want to give back. Without funding and local support, the events wouldn't happen. TEDxBreckenridge does not receive donations from the national "TED" organization so local funding makes a difference.

## Reason 2: The goal is to Expand Intellectual Thinking

From the outside, Breckenridge is seen as a community of athletes, tourists, and partiers, but it is so much more than that. One of TEDxBreckenridge's goals is to deepen the intellectual curiosity of our community. Our organization does this by bringing the community together to learn, explore, and engage in insightful conversation. Breckenridge is one of the most visited ski towns in the United States. Because of this, many of the events in Breckenridge, such as Breckenridge Strings, Ciders, and Souls Festival, and the Breckenridge Summer Beer Festival, center around skiing or alcohol. TEDxBreckenridge is different because it focuses on education and ideas.

## Reason 3: Giving makes you happy

Not only does supporting TEDxBreckenridge help Breckenridge, it also makes you feel good. Researchers at Stony Brook University explain that generosity releases chemicals into our brains that bring joy. Generosity is contagious and makes the people around you happier. You don't have to give your money. Giving your time or talents can make a difference. Volunteering is a great way to meet new people!

## Reason 4: Individuals Make It Happen

Organizations count on individuals to help support nonprofits. The largest source of charitable giving in the United States comes from individuals, and made up 64% of all donations in 2022 to nonprofits. According to Double the Donation, 81% of donors attend the events they support financially. So, if you plan on going to this year's TED Talk, "Instinct," consider donating, too.

## Reason 5: Nonpartisan/No Political Agenda

TEDxBreckenridge has no political agenda and is a nonpartisan organization. None of the speakers are allowed to make political speeches, discuss religious beliefs, or promote their businesses. It is simply a place for people to come together, engage with each other, share, and learn.

So why donate? Well, it deepens the academic side of Breckenridge, makes you feel good, and expands our community. Any money donated goes directly to TEDxBreckenridge, which is a nonprofit organization. It helps the nonprofit work towards attracting the best speakers, coaches, along with putting on the best events possible. Also, high-quality production of the videos ensures TED will put the videos on their YouTube channel, so that Breckenridge can be known globally for big ideas.

There are other ways to help out too, such as volunteering for TEDxBreckenridge. Supporting TEDxBreckenridge is a way to support and expand this community that people from all over love.
