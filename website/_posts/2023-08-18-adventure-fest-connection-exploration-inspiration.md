**_An Event to Inspire Exploration_**

By Charlotte Callahan

While people come to Breckenridge from many different cultures, countries, and backgrounds, a shared love of adventure often connects them.

"Adventure Fest" was the theme of the TEDxBreckenridge Club Event on Tuesday, July 18. Participants watched recorded TEDx Talks on adventure and its powerful effects while engaging with each other and answering adventure-related questions throughout the evening. It was the summer's third "book club without a book" event. The events bring everyone interested in TEDxBreckenridge together monthly for connection, conversation, and fun.

The evening began with a poem to get the creative juices flowing. Then, participants watched three talks highlighting a surf photographer who works in freezing water, a man who trekked across the South Pole, and a woman who set a new record for sailing worldwide. These three talks show how to take lessons from your adventures and apply them to everyday life. They showed a sense of gratitude and a desire to learn.

Audience members formed small discussion groups to explore the question, **_"Why is adventure important?"_**

 The room was buzzing with conversation.

"_Adventure feeds the soul,_" said one woman in my group.

"_It keeps your mind and body growing,_" said another participant.

Someone else shared the difference between adventure and activities, saying that adventures are often spontaneous.

Later, attendees watched three more talks about how nature inspires curiosity. My favorite talk of the night was from a scientist who grew up hearing a myth about a boiling section of water in the Amazon River. The other two talks were by a woman who swims through underwater caves and a man who studies biological dark matter.

The next question was, **"Where, or what, do you want to explore?"**

Some people said they wanted to explore scientific ideas, such as fungi or nutrition, while others said they wanted to explore places. One viewer answered, "_Not underwater caves_!" a sentiment with which most people agreed.

 Being in Breckenridge, spontaneity and opportunity for adventure are everywhere. This night inspired adventure and curiosity. We are lucky enough to be surrounded by the great outdoors and should take every opportunity.
